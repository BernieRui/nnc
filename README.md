# NODEC: NODEC: Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Control

A framework for neural network control of dynamical systems over graphs.
The current repository is based on the work presented in the  paper:
- Asikis, T., BÃ¶ttcher, L., & Antulov-Fantulin, N. (2020). NODEC: Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Control of Dynamical Systems on Graphs.

The paper updated version will be found with many new experiments and content in:

The NNC module aims to offer neural network controllers in pytorch.
NODEC is a novel method that controls dynamical systems that describe the evolution and interactions of networked components.
We refer to these components as state variables on a graph.
A graph consists of nodes that are conncected with edges.
Each node is assigned a state variable value, and this value evolves through time according to some interaction rules that are described in the form of an 
ordinary differential equation.
External control signals may be applied to a subset of nodes to guide the evolution of the system towards a target state.
The main idea is to use neural networks, and more specifically Neural ODEs to learn the aforementioned control signals in a non-supervised manner.

## Examples

For now NNC and NODEC work only with pytorch, and we offer a very simple yet descriptive example on continuous time time-invariant dynamics, which can be found in:
- `examples/ct_lti_small/small_example.ipynb` or `examples/ct_lti_small/small_example.ipynb`
- [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/asikist/nnc/blob/master/examples/ct_lti_small/small_example.ipynb)

The repository will be updated regularly with latest research work and applications.
Our aim is to showcase the capabilities of NODEC, especially for high-dimensional non-linear dynamics.

## Requirements
Requirements to run nnc and its examples.

### Software:

Module dependencies (`nnc/*`):
- Python 3.6+
- torch 1.4+
- [torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq)
- numpy 1.17.2+
- scipy =1.3.1+

As neural networks rely on stochastic initialization, results may vary from paper if a bad initialization is used.
Our current seed setting proceedure is not enough to ensure replication,
but with a few runs reproducability of similar results to the paper is possible.

Example dependencies (for scripts under `examples/*`):
- plotly 4+
- tqdm
- pandas

#### Project structure
In code you may find 4 folders, and their contents are described as:
- `nnc` the main neural network control module with utilities and baselines for neural network control.
- `nodec_experiments` the folder containing the scripts that train and evaluate NODEC vs other baselines.
- `test`: a folder with unit tests on some methods, which in the future will expand to achieve full coverage.
- `examples`: a folder with unit tests, which in the future will expand to achieve full coverage of the project.

### Hardware
We tested most our experiments on both CUDA and CPU.
We advise using CUDA with more than 8GB of VRAM for training of NODEC.
